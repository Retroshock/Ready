# Ready

There are 2 screens:

Main screen that shows a tableView with all the android repos (I have looked into paginating but there seemed to only be one page). The repos are sorted by the number of stars

You can click a repo to see more details about it (Number of forks, number of watchers, readme(if available), the owner and the link). The readme is visible on the bottom formatted for markup.

There are some light tests that are used to determine if the api calls return proper response.
